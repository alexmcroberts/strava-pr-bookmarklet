Strava PR Bookmarklet
=====================

A bookmarklet for the strava.com activities page to show a breakdown of total achievements

To test this out once you edit the JavaScript, you'll need to convert the JavaScript to a bookmarklet. I've used [Peter Cole's](http://mrcoles.com/bookmarklet/) to convert the code to a bookmarklet. Once it's converted, drag the blue "this link" button to your Bookmark Bar, go a Strava Activity page, and test it out!
